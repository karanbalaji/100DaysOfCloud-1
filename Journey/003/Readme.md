## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I got stuck looking for billing alarm. Thought maybee billing alarm was the same as creating a budget but it's not.  When it would ask to select metrics I was lost. In the end I learned how to make a $5  budget.

## Next Steps

Not sure what I want to do next, I will select a new project tomorrow.
