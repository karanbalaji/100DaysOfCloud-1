# Create a DynamoDB

Introduction:

**I chose to do the DynamoDB project from 100DaysOfCloud because I would hear people talk about DynamoDB and I wanted to get a better understanding of it.

Prerequisite:

**To be honest I'm not sure what base knowledge you need for DynamoDB, defintly Certified Cloud Practitioner.

Cloud Research:

## Run a scan on the table that returns all 3 items

**(Not really sure what I‚Äôm doing so I‚Äôm going to watch some videos on youtube)**

**I scanned table but I‚Äôm lost on how to return all 3 items... So I‚Äôm going to skip this and be done for today** ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Does DynamoDB support Encryption?

**Yes DynamoDB supports encryption**

## What are Global Tables?

**Global tables is a replica of one or more replica tables all from one AWS account.**

Cloud Outcome

**I learned that DynamoDB is confusing and I will need to take more time to understand it, but I did learn how to make the DynamoDB with provisioned capacity and how to create items in a table.

Next Steps

**I'm going to checkout more of the project ideas tomorrow to see what intrests me next to learn!**
